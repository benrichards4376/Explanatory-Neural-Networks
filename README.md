# Explanatory-Neural-Networks
Our Senior Design project focuses on advancing the field of artificial intelligence by enhancing the transparency and interpretability of neural networks. We are working on integrating explainable nodes into existing neural network architectures to shed light on the decision-making processes within these networks. By leveraging activation and backpropagated values, our project aims to provide insights into the inner workings of neural networks, making AI technology more comprehensible and accountable. Through collaboration with Dr. James Baker from Carnegie Mellon, we have access to cutting-edge knowledge and mentorship, positioning us to contribute to the evolution of AI technology and the development of more interpretable neural networks.
